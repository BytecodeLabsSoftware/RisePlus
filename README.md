# RisePlus
Rise+ is a modified version of Rise client with bug fixes, additional features, more customizability, etc.

## Disclaimers
Rise+ is not open source since I don't want people skidding new bypasses and stuff. Also, please refrain from deobfuscating and decompiling the jar.

This repository is to download releases or give us some feedback. Feel free to make an issue on here, whether it be a bug fix request or simple bypass suggestion.

**The actual code for this project comes from a Rise 6.0 source code leak from 2023. I did not decompile Rise by any means.**
## How to use Rise+
### Step 1: Extract files from the zip file
No explaination needed here, just move the files to a folder where Rise+ can actually be ran.

### Step 2: Locate the batch file and run it
After you have extracted everything, go and find the launch.bat file and run it. This will start Rise+. To close Rise+ (you can't do it normally because backend bullshit), go to the command prompt window and press CTRL and C, then if it prompts you, type "Y".
